# SQL Injection Payloads Collection

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Gamgoma00, this repository contains a collection of SQL Injection (SQLi) payloads commonly used for testing and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications.

## How to Use
To use these payloads, simply copy and paste the desired payload into the SQL query parameter you're testing for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### Example:
If the parameter 'user' is vulnerable to SQL injection, try injecting:user=admin' or '1'='1 
- Please use these payloads responsibly and only test websites and applications that you have permission to test. Unauthorized use of these payloads is illegal and unethical.

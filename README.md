# SQL Injection Payloads Collection

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Gamgoma00, this repository contains a collection of SQL Injection (SQLi) payloads commonly used for testing and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications.

## How to Use
To use these payloads, simply copy and paste the desired payload into the SQL query parameter you're testing for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### Example:
If the parameter 'user' is vulnerable to SQL injection, try injecting:user=admin' or '1'='1 
## SQLi Payload Categories:
- **Boolean-Based**
- **Time-Based**
- **Error-Based**
- **Union-Based**

## Important Note:
These payloads are for educational and testing purposes only. Always make sure you have permission before testing any application or website for vulnerabilities.
